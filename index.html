    <h1>What is the Odin project?</h1> <!--<h1> through <h9> are all heading tags. 1 is the biggest and when interpreted by a browser is considered the most important-->
    <p>The <em><strong>Odin Project</strong></em> is an open source  <!--<em> is the italics tag. <strong> is the bold tag. <p> is the paragraph tag-->
    project that is used to help beginners learn web development from a bottom
    up approach. I am looking forward to seeing my progress throughout the duration
    of this project!
    </p>

    <p>Now I am going to demonstrate unordered lists <strong><em>ul</em></strong> and <strong> <em>li</em></strong> which are list items</p>

    <p>This is an example of an unordered list
        <ul>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Apple</li>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>This is an example of an ordered list
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
